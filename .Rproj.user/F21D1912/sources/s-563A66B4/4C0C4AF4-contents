This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r install and load tidyverse}
#only if you have not installed them yet
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


```{r load libaries}
#Packages need to be installed first with install.packages("library_name")
library(tidyverse)

#Which packages are included in tidyverse?
#What does 'Conflicts' means?
```

```{r load data}
#Load data that is in the folder 'plotting'


#What are the column specifications?
#Character, numeric, factor?
```

```{r Explore data}
#Familiarize yourself with the data
#Adjust column specification



```

```{r Mapping data}
#Map the sampling locations by using the package tmap (sf is needed as well)
#A lot of geospatial analysis can be done in R - there is a lot to explore!


```

```{r Plotting data}
#Create exploratory figures (boxplots and scatterplots) and plot them on one page with the help of the package ggplot and ggpubr
#Save your plot as jpeg and pdf



```
